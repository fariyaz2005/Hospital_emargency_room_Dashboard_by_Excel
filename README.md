## Overview
This project presents a **Hospital Emergency Room Dashboard** created entirely in **Microsoft Excel** to visualize and analyze key monthly performance metrics of a hospital’s emergency department.

The dashboard demonstrates how Excel can be used for **data analytics and visualization** in the healthcare domain — without using any external add-ins or BI tools.

Inspired by the work and tutorials of **Satish Dhawale**.
